- [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) is a simple but powerful text format specification that is quickly being adopted by many in academics and elsewhere as the format of choice for manuscripts, presentations, and other scholarly writing

- [Remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark) is a great javascript file that turns markdown into html5 presentations that can be viewed in just about any browser

  - Thus, your presentations are:

      - editable with any plain text editor, such as a code editor

      - viewable in any standards-compliant web browser and on any device or platform

- This demo presentation shows some custom features that I have written over time to assist with making good-looking presentations with Remark

- This does not cover any of the many features of Remark itself

  - For that, you can read the [wiki](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki)
